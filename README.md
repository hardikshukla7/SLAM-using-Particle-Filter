# SLAM for Mobile Robots using Particle Filter

## Project Overview

This project implements Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) for mobile robots utilizing a Particle Filter. By leveraging Particle Filtering with iterative weight resampling, along with Lidar and odometry data, we can accurately forecast the robot's subsequent state and enhance its navigation capabilities.

## Key Contributions

- **Particle Filtering**: Employed particle filtering techniques to improve state estimation by integrating Lidar and odometry data.
- **Depth Camera Integration**: Utilized a depth camera to capture environmental data, facilitating robust log-based graph mapping.

### Dynamics Step

Using the dynamics step, we obtain the trajectory created from odometry sensors and the Particle Filter. It's essential to recognize that sensor data can be noisy and inaccurate. However, the trajectories generated by the particle filter filter out this noise, providing a reliable approximation of the optimal trajectory to be followed. Below are the graphs illustrating these trajectories:

## Mapping Environment

In my implementation, the environment is mapped using logistic probability. The Lidar camera detects obstacles in the robot's surroundings, identifying potentially occupied grid cells. By comparing this data with previous estimates (from the last pose), we update our logarithmic graph.

### Occupied and Unoccupied Cells

- **Occupied Cells**: If the logarithmic value for a grid cell exceeds a threshold after multiple observations, we classify it as occupied.
- **Unoccupied Cells**: For unoccupied cells, we cast a line segment from the current pose to all endpoints identified by the Lidar. All grid cells along this segment are marked as unoccupied. We iteratively update the logarithmic values; if a cell's value falls below a minimum threshold, it's classified as unoccupied.
